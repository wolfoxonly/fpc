Flashpaychain Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Flashpaychain Core is the original Flashpaychain client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Flashpaychain transactions (which is currently more than 100 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Flashpaychain Core, visit [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Flashpaychain on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/Flashpaychain-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/Flashpaychaind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run Flashpaychain-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Flashpaychain-Core to your applications folder, and then run Flashpaychain-Core.
